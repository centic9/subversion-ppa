Suggests: subversion-tools, db5.1-util, patch
Description: Advanced version control system
 Apache Subversion, also known as svn, is a centralised version control
 system.  Version control systems allow many individuals (who may be
 distributed geographically) to collaborate on a set of files (source
 code, websites, etc).  Subversion began with a CVS paradigm and
 supports all the major features of CVS, but has evolved to support
 many features that CVS users often wish they had.
 .
 This package includes the Subversion client (svn), repository
 administration tools (svnadmin, svnlook) and a network server (svnserve).

Package: libsvn1
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: same
Pre-Depends: multiarch-support
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Shared libraries used by Apache Subversion
 This package includes shared libraries to manipulate Apache Subversion
 (svn) repositories and working copies.  See the 'subversion' package for
 more information.

Suggests: libsvn-doc, zlib1g-dev, libneon27-gnutls-dev
Description: Development files for Apache Subversion libraries
 This package contains the symlinks, headers, and object files needed
 to compile and link programs which use libsvn1, the Apache Subversion
 libraries.  This package is needed only in order to compile software
 that uses libsvn1.

Package: libsvn-doc
Suggests: libsvn-dev
Section: doc
Priority: extra
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}

Package: libapache2-svn
Section: httpd
Architecture: any
Depends: apache2.2-common, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Suggests: db5.1-util
Description: Apache Subversion server modules for Apache httpd
 This package provides the mod_dav_svn and mod_authz_svn modules for
 the Apache 2.2 web server.  These modules provide Apache Subversion's WebDAV
