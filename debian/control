Description: Advanced version control system
 Apache Subversion, also known as svn, is a centralised version control
 system.  Version control systems allow many individuals (who may be
 distributed geographically) to collaborate on a set of files (source
 code, websites, etc).  Subversion began with a CVS paradigm and
 supports all the major features of CVS, but has evolved to support
 many features that CVS users often wish they had.
 .
 This package includes the Subversion client (svn), repository
 administration tools (svnadmin, svnlook) and a network server (svnserve).
